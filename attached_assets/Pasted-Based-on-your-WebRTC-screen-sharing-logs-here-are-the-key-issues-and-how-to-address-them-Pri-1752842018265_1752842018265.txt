Based on your WebRTC screen sharing logs, here are the key issues and how to address them:

## Primary Connection Issues

**ICE Connection Failure**: The connection progresses through the normal handshake but fails during ICE connectivity checks. This indicates network traversal problems - your peers can exchange signaling messages but can't establish a direct media connection.

**NAT/Firewall Problems**: The failure pattern (checking → disconnected → failed) suggests that despite having STUN/TURN servers configured, the ICE candidates aren't successfully creating a viable connection path between the peers.

**Timing Issues**: The tracks are ending prematurely during the connection failure, which suggests the media stream is being terminated when the connection drops rather than being preserved for reconnection.

## Root Causes

**Insufficient TURN Server Reliability**: Your hybrid STUN/TURN configuration is failing, indicating either inadequate TURN server capacity, incorrect credentials, or geographic/network distance issues between peers and TURN servers.

**ICE Candidate Selection Problems**: The logs show multiple ICE candidates being generated and exchanged, but none are establishing a successful connection. This suggests the candidate prioritization or selection process isn't working optimally.

**Connection State Race Conditions**: The rapid state changes (connecting → failed → retry) indicate the system might be giving up too quickly on connections that could potentially succeed with more time.

## Solutions to Implement

**Improve TURN Infrastructure**: Use multiple TURN servers in different geographic locations with proper load balancing. Ensure your TURN servers have sufficient bandwidth and are properly configured for your network topology.

**Implement Progressive ICE Strategies**: Start with a more aggressive ICE gathering approach, collecting more candidates before attempting connection. Set `iceCandidatePoolSize` higher and allow more time for ICE gathering to complete.

**Add Connection Recovery Logic**: Instead of immediately failing over to TURN-only mode, implement a staged retry approach: first retry with the same configuration, then try TURN-only, then try with different TURN servers.

**Enhance Media Stream Management**: Implement proper stream lifecycle management so that when connections fail, the media streams are preserved and can be reattached to new peer connections without requiring the presenter to restart sharing.

**Implement Connection Quality Monitoring**: Add bandwidth and latency monitoring to detect network quality issues before they cause connection failures. This allows for proactive connection optimization.

**Add Timeout Adjustments**: The connection appears to be timing out too quickly. Implement adaptive timeout values based on network conditions and connection history.

**Improve Error Recovery**: When tracks end unexpectedly, implement automatic stream recovery that requests a new stream from the presenter rather than requiring manual intervention.

The core issue is that your current setup assumes a relatively stable network environment, but real-world conditions require more robust fallback mechanisms and better TURN server infrastructure.
